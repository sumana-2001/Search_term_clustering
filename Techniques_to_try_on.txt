1) Collect and analyze the dataset(IMPLEMENTED)


2) Perform Data Imputation(perform considering row wise manner)
	UNIVARIATE APPROACH
	--> mean, median, mode
	--> simpleImputer
	--> Interpolate
	--> Replace with some random value
	MULTIVARIATE APPROACH
	--> KNNImputer, IterativeImputer  (IMPLEMENTED)
	SWARM OPTIMIZATION
	-->A_Study_of_Data_Imputation_Using_Fuzzy_C-Means_with_Particle_Swarm_Optimization
	-->Particle swarm optimization and covariance matrix based data imputation


3) Exploratory Data Analysis
	--> Plot curve for 30 best,worst search terms sorted with maximum frequency comparitively (X : weeks, Y : Search term)                   (IMPLEMENTED)
	--> Check for the consistent search terms which are not having drastic incline or decline in frequency(they are mostly prefered) 
	--> box,violin plots to check for outliers

4) Feature Selection using ANOVA (Not Using)

5) Clustering techniques
	--> Time Series Clustering
	--> KNN clustering
	--> Hierachical clustering
	--> Fuzzy clustering
	--> DB scan / density based clustering
	--> partitional Clustering
6) Profiling the clusters
